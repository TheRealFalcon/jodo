# JODO

Jodo provides a single CLI interface to interact with multiple cloud providers.

## Installation

Jodo can be `pip install`ed into any environment, but [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/) is recommended:

```bash
pipx install jodo
```

Also currently requires https://github.com/canonical/pycloudlib/pull/324

## Configuration

Pycloudlib must be configured as described in the [pycloudlib documentation](https://pycloudlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html).

## Usage

jodo launch --cloud lxd_container --image jammy my-instance
```

### List all instances

## Status

This is a project I quickly hacked together in my free time and should be considered minimum viable functionality. It currently has no testing, no logging, no exception handling, no documentation (other than this README), and no guarantees about state or schema compatibility. If you use it you will see glaringly obvious bugs. Feel free to submit an issue or PR.
